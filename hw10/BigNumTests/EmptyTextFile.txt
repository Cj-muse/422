Dev notes:

Questions:
	Design question, where should trailing and leading zeros be removed?
		my initialization function seems to remove leading zeros but not trailing zeros.
		Should I take car of this at initialization or toString.

	Answer, as i wrote this I relized that it would probably be best to perform all
	zero truncation at initialization.  that way no other class function will need 
	to worry about it during the life-time of the object.
